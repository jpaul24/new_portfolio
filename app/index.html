            <h3>A WEB DEVELOPER WITH A FOCUS ON FRONT END AND LEARNING THE NEWEST TECHNOLOGIES</h3>
            <p>I was unsure what sort of career I wanted when I left school, and so, at the age of nineteen, I did something even more frightening, I moved to Vancouver, Canada and ended up spending the next 4 years building lasting relationships,  developing a wide range of skills and exploring the world.</p>
            <p>A friend of mine in Vancouver, an experienced Graphic Designer, was building a website for his company <a href="https://tinytomatodesign.com/" target="_blank">Tiny Tomato</a> and my interest was sparked by the technologies he was using to build his website.</p>
            <p>In June 2018 I began teaching myself web development. I was eager to learn, being focused and driven towards my goal. I used online resources such as Udemy and Codecademy courses. After learning the basics of web development I started to focus my attention on JavaScript; knowing that the subject was vast and would require concentrated effort on my part.
            </p>
            <p>I knew that this was the career path I wanted to follow and was keen to find a learning platform that was more tangible, more project based and a place where I could continue to develop and learn. I gave up work and attended <a href="https://www.lewagon.com/" target="_blank" class="about-link">Le Wagon</a> during the summer of 2019. The course covered the essentials for Full-Stack Development and during my time on the course, I discovered a passion for Front-End development but with a firm grounding, knowledge and appreciation for the work involved in back-end development.</p>
            <p>Since the bootcamp I have been concentrating on learning more and creating more websites with an emphasis on extending my JavaScript skills and using React/Redux to familiarise myself with the ever-changing technologies that are being made available.</p>
            <p>I have been working as a Freelance Developer but I am eager to find work in the tech industry and to continue my development in a professional setting. I'm looking forward to continuing my education in this challenging environment that I find myself attracted to.</p>

            <p><strong>Jaunt is a Ruby on Rails application optimised for mobile devices. Jaunt was the final project at Le Wagon</strong></p>
            <p>I thought of the idea behind Jaunt, pitched it to others on the course and gained the respect of three wonderful team players that wanted to work on the application with me. I took on a project management role to bring Jaunt, and my vision, to life.</p>
            <p>Jaunt is best described as Tinder for travellers. Users enter a city that they intend to visit, they enter the length of their stay, and the application offers a range of activities that they can choose to ignore or accept. Accepted activities are then used to pre-populate their calendar for the length of their stay. </p>
            <p>The application draws on resources that include: devise (logins); pundit (authentication); geocoding and maps (mapbox); javascript for swipe (swing.js); AJAX; cloudinary for image upload.</p>

            <p><strong>Let it Grow, is a Ruby on Rails application that was built with the same team members as Jaunt. It is a market place application based on Air BnB and the purpose of developing the application was to develop an understanding of application workflow and the processes of application development as part of a team effort.</strong></p>
            <p>Let it Grow, allows a user to rent or rent out a garden space, be it for a party or a casual bit of gardening.</p>
            <p>The application draws on resources that include: devise (logins); geocoding and maps (mapbox); AJAX (star rating).</p>

            <p><strong>Real Good Fitness is a static website for a local Personal Trainer built to improve their online presence and generate more business from the local and regional area.</strong></p>
            <p>This application was wireframed using Figma which promotes the design of scalable websites, and for this project, was an invaluable resource for front end design, CSS and HTML development. For this project, I taught myself the essentials of Gulp, a toolkit to assist in automating painful or time-consuming tasks.</p>
            <p>The application is still under development but draws on resources that include: Figma (web design); Gulp (development toolkit); jQuery.</p>
