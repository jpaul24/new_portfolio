            <h3>A WEB DEVELOPER WITH A FOCUS ON FRONT END AND LEARNING THE NEWEST TECHNOLOGIES</h3>
            <p>I was unsure what sort of career I wanted when I left school so I took the opportunity to see what was out there and explore the world. At age 19 I moved to Vancouver, Candada and ended up spending the next 4 years there building lasting relationships and developing a wide range of skills from jobs.</p>
            <p>While in Vancouver, a friend I met there, who is an experienced Graphic Designer, was building his website for his company <a href="https://tinytomatodesign.com/" target="_blank">Tiny Tomato</a>. I took an interest in the development of his site and the technologies that he was using.</p>
            <p>From there in June 2018 I began teaching myself as much about web development as I could using the resources available online such as Udemy courses and Codecademy. I focussed on JavaScript after learning the basics because I could see the possibilities from knowing it were vast.</p>
            <p>I was certain that this was career path I wanted to follow so was eager to find something more project based where I could continue to develop and learn. I attended <a href="https://www.lewagon.com/" target="_blank" class="about-link">Le Wagon</a> during the summer of 2019 where they cover the essentials to Full-Stack Development. During my time there I found a passion for the Front End side of development but I value the knowledge I have of the whole process.</p>
            <p>Since the bootcamp I have been engrossed in learning more and builiding more and have been focussing on extending my JavaScript skills and using React/Redux and familiarising myself with the ever changing technologies available.</p>
            <p>I have been doing work as a Freelance Developer but I'm eager to find work in the tech industry to continue my development in a professional environment. I'm extremely open to continuing my education.</p>

            <p><strong>Jaunt is a Ruby on Rails app optimised for mobile. It was the final project at Le Wagon where I worked as part of a wonderful team of 4</strong></p>
            <p>I pitched the idea and people chose to work on it with me so I took on a collaborative project management role to bring the vision to life.</p>
            <p>Described best as Tinder for travelling, the user enters a city they're visiting and how long they're are going for and the app will offer a range of activities to swipe through and then will auto-populate your calendar for your time there.</p>
            <p>The app includes: devise (logins); pundit (authentication); geocoding and maps (mapbox); javascript for swipe (swing.js); AJAX; cloudinary for image upload.</p>

            <p><strong>A Ruby on Rails app built with the same team as Jaunt, to understand workflow and building as part of a team. It is a market place app based on Air BnB.</strong></p>
            <p>It is a site on which a user can rent or rent out a garden, be it for a party or a casual bit of gardening.</p>
            <p>The app includes: devise (logins); geocoding and maps (mapbox); AJAX (star rating)</p>

            <p><strong>Static website built for a local Personal Trainer to improve their online presence and build more business from the area.</strong></p>
            <p>Wireframed before building using Figma to understand the importance of having a design to follow during development. Used front end design and the CSS and HTML which I have developed strong skills in. Taught myself how to use Gulp as a toolkit to help in the development.</p>

            <p>Made a number of funtions to make the game work and used important elements of JavaScript such as Event Listeners and interacting with the DOM.</p>
